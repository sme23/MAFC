Hello?[.....] Is anyone here?[A][NL]
I got a letter from General Seth[NL]
telling me to report here for today[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadAmelia][MoveFarLeft]
This is where General Duessel told[NL]
me to go for training today[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
[OpenLeft]
Oh![......] Amelia![A][NL]
Are you here for training, too?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Yes, I am.[A][NL]
General Duessel mentioned something[NL]
about a special sword training protocol,[A][NL]
and told me to report here[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Is there even anyone else here?[A]
[OpenFarFarRight][LoadLute]
Oh, they're here![A]
[MoveMidRight]
Hello to the both of you.[A][NL]
Today, you'll be helping test a new[NL]
method of training I have developed.[A][NL]
Ever since the terrors of the[NL]
Demon King ceased to roam this world,[A][NL]
an easy method of practical battle experience[NL]
has also disappeared alongside them.[A][NL]
Therefore, I've taken it upon myself to[NL]
formulate a new method of experience gain.[A]
[OpenLeft]
What exactly is your new training method?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Initially I wanted to summon monsters[NL]
again in a controlled environment,[A][NL]
but the international council that is[NL]
funding my research refused to allow this.[A][NL]
So, I have developed a method of creating[NL]
a controlled number of illusory soldiers[A][NL]
from designated locations using magic.[A][NL]
To demonstrate, I will spawn a soldier.[A]

Lute, what the hell did you do!?[A][NL]
There are enemy soldiers[NL]
appearing all over the place![A]
[OpenFarLeft]
We have to do something![A][NL]
We can't let them ravage[NL]
across the land![A]
[OpenMidRight]
Unfortunately, there is not a way to disperse[NL]
the illusions after they have been spawned.[A][NL]
You will have to go out and do so manually.[A][MoveFarFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft]
Damn it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]

[OpenMidRight][LoadEirika]
I have recently begun[NL]
learning to use magic.[A][NL]
Please, allow me to[NL]
use it to assist you.[A]

I'll take all the hands we can get.[A][NL]
Thank you.[A][X]
