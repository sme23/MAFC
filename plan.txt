Your army is entirely trainees
Unit stats and classes carry through reset? (maybe)
zero story ideas
zero ideas on how you'll see valkyrie anims since probably won't promote from past trainee level

characters:
-Ross (Journeyman)
-Amelia (Recruit)
-Ewan (Pupil)
(ofc)

-Nino (Pupil F)
-Atlas (Journeyman)
-Faye (Villager F)
-Delthea (Pupil F)
-Est (Recruit)
-Mozu (Villager F)
-Tobin (Villager M)
-Gray (Villager M)


You can pick 6(?) of them when you begin; team comp is up to you, so you can take them by base weapon type and promote however you want to build the team comp you want
Maybe do Paragon on all of them? as class skills even

enemies are all early game prepromotes (with normal base stats, ofc)
-Jagen
-Arran
-Boah
-Marcus
-Seth
-Titania
-Sothe

dunno how tf can make it fun to play though
